# GunHead (ConU Game Jam 2022)

### This game was created for Concordia's October 2022  Game Jam!

## Theme

The theme for the Jam is *There was... Then there was Not*

## Who are we?

We are a team of 6 engineers (software, computer, electrical), half of whom had to leave to study for midterms during the jam. :(
We all have backgrounds of programming and game enjoying, but for the majority of us, this is our first game jam experience!
Most of our art assets were taken and modified from the Unity asset store, but a couple of our teammates decided to give animation and music creation a try.

## Synopsis 
You wake up as a gun with legs, remembering only that your loved one was taken from you. You seek to find answers to your questions while exacting revenge, but your actions may lead to something more devastating...
